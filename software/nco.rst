The netCDF Operators (NCO) are a suite of standalone, command-line programs like,
e.g., ls or mkdir. Each operator takes netCDF files as input, then operates
(e.g., derives new data, averages, hyperslabs, manipulates metadata) and produces
a netCDF output file. NCO primarily aids manipulation and analysis of gridded
scientific data.
