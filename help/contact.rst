About support requests
----------------------

* Requests will be handled as soon as possible by the support staff.
* Please be as detailed as possible about your problem when submitting
  a support request, as this will help the support personnel to solve
  your problem faster.
* Please do not send support requests directly to staff members.
  Response time is shorter, and your request does not risk getting
  lost in a huge mailbox if you use the support system.
* Working hours for the support staff are Monday-Friday
  08:00-16:00, except holidays.
