How to write good support requests
==================================

Writing good support requests is not only good for the support team, it is also
better for you because we will understand your request sooner and will be able
to resolve it faster. Below is a list of good practices.


Never send support requests to staff members directly
-----------------------------------------------------

Always send them to support-uit@notur.no and staff members will pick them
up there. On support-uit@notur.no they get tracked and have higher visibility.
Some staff members work on the support line only part time.
Sending the request to support-uit@notur.no makes sure that somebody will pick
it up.


Give descriptive subject
------------------------

Your subject line should be descriptive. "Problem on Stallo" is not a good
subject line since it says nothing. The support staff is a team. The subjects
are the first thing that we see. We would like to be able to classify emails
according to subjects before even opening the email.


New problem new email
---------------------

Do send support requests replying to unrelated issues. Every issue gets a
number and this is the number that you see in the subject line. Replying to
unrelated issues means that your email gets filed under the wrong thread and
risks being overlooked.


The XY problem
--------------

This is a classic problem. Please read http://xyproblem.info.  Often we know
the solution but sometimes we don't know the problem.

In short (quoting from http://xyproblem.info):

* User wants to do X.

* User doesn't know how to do X, but thinks they can fumble their way to a solution if they can just manage to do Y.

* User doesn't know how to do Y either.

* User asks for help with Y.

* Others try to help user with Y, but are confused because Y seems like a strange problem to want to solve.

* After much interaction and wasted time, it finally becomes clear that the user really wants help with X, and that Y wasn't even a suitable solution for X.

To avoid the XY problem, if you struggle with Y but really what you are after
is X, please also tell us about X. Tell us what you really want to achieve.
Solving Y can take a long time.  We have had cases where after enormous effort
on Y we realized that the user wanted X and that Y was not the best way to
achieve X.


Tell us also what worked
------------------------

Rather often we requests of the type "I cannot get X to run on two nodes".  The
request then does not mention whether it worked on one node or on one core or
whether it never worked and this is the first attempt.  In order to better
isolate the problem and avoid wasting time with many back and forth emails,
please tell us what actually worked so far.  Tell us what you have tried to
isolate the problem.  This requires some effort from you but this is what we
expect from you.


Be specific
-----------

The better you describe the problem the less we have to guess and ask.
Make the problem reproducible. See also next point.


Create an example which reproduces the problem
----------------------------------------------

Create an example that we can ideally just copy paste and run and which
demonstrates the problem. It is otherwise very time consuming if the support
team needs to write input files and run scripts based on your possible
incomplete description. See also next point.


Make the example as small and fast as possible
----------------------------------------------

You run a calculation which crashes after running for one week.  Before you
send a support request with this example, first try to reduce it. Possibly and
probably the crash can be reproduced with a much smaller example (smaller
system size or grid or basis set).

It is so much easier to schedule and debug a problem which crashes after few
seconds compared to a run which crashes after hours.

Of course this requires some effort from you but this is what we expect from
you in order to create a useful support request.
