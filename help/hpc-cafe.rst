HPC cafe for all users
======================
Ask and discuss questions related to Stallo, Fram & Saga
--------------------------------------------------------

Every month or two we invite all users of our computing and storage systems
to meet and we try to answer all your questions.
It doesn't matter from which institute or university you are,
you are welcome to join. 
Meet the HPC staff, discuss problems and project
ideas, give feedback or suggestions on how to improve services, and get
advice for your computational research projects.

Join us on `Zoom <https://uit.zoom.us/j/61045905739>`_, get yourself a coffee
or tea and have a chat.
We can talk about:

- Problems/questions regarding the Stallo/Vilje shutdown and migration
