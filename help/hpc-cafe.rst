HPC cafe
========

Once a month we hang out somewhere on UiT campus. You can come by, meet the HPC
staff, ask questions, discuss problems and project ideas, give feedback or
suggestions on how to improve services, and get advice for your computational
research projects.

Bring your laptop and your job scripts, and come hang out with us and get some
coffee or tea or some cookies.

We can talk about:

- How to improve your run scripts
- Help with scripting
- Help with programming and software management
- Help with project organization and data management
- Help with Linux stuff
- How to improve performance of your calculations
- "Papercuts": things that annoy you and how we can fix that
- How to improve services
- Project ideas
- Learn about cool services that you may not know yet
