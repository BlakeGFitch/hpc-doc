HPC cafe
========

Every month or two we hang out on the UiT campus and/or online.
You can come by, meet the HPC staff, ask questions, discuss problems and
project ideas, give feedback or suggestions on how to improve services,
and get advice for your computational research projects.

Join us on Zoom, bring your own coffee or tea and have a chat.


We can talk about:

- How to improve your run scripts
- Help with scripting
- Help with programming and software management
- Help with project organization and data management
- Help with Linux stuff
- How to improve performance of your calculations
- "Papercuts": things that annoy you and how we can fix that
- How to improve services
- Project ideas
- Learn about cool services that you may not know yet
