Before you start using Stallo, please read the :doc:`University of Tromsø's guidelines <guidelines>`.

How to get an account and a CPU quota on Stallo
===============================================

To be able to work on Stallo you must have an account and you must have
been granted CPU time on the system. There are two ways to achieve this:

Research Council Quota
------------------------

National users (including users from UiT) may apply for an account and
a CPU quota from the Research Councils share of Stallo. If you want to
apply for such a quota please use this `form.  <http://www.notur.no/quotas/apply>`_

UiT Quota
-----------

“Local users” (i.e. users from UiT and users affiliated with UiT in some way) can apply for an account and
a quota from UiT’s share of Stallo. If you wan to apply for such a quota
please use this `form. <http://uit.no/ansatte/organisasjon/artikkel?p_document_id=299809&p_dimension_id=88223&p_menu=49281>`_

Please note that most users who are allowed to apply for a UiT quota
also are allowed to apply for a quota from the Research Council –
at the same time!
