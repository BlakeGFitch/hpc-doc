Information regarding help-desk support

How to get user support.

There are two standard ways to achieve user support:

Email: :doc:`support-uit@notur.no <mailto:support-uit@notur.no>`

Web:
`http://support.notur.no/ <http://support.notur.no/>`_

Which method you choose does not matter, since all messages ends up in
the same system. However, using the web page requires a user name and a
password, which are automatically generated the first time you
send an email to :doc:`support-uit@notur.no <mailto:support-uit@notur.no>`.
From the web page you can also track your requests.

 Please remember to consult the :doc:`Stallo User Guide <.>` and the
:ref:`faq` for information that you are looking for.

 

About support requests
----------------------

* Requests will be handled as soon as possible by the support staff.
* Please be as detailed as possible about your problem when submitting
  a support request, as this will help the support personal to solve
  your problem faster.
* Please do not send support requests directly to staff members. 
  Response time is shorter, and your request does not risk getting
  lost in a huge mailbox. 
* Working hours for the support staff are Monday-Friday
  08:00-16:00, except holidays.
