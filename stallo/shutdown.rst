Stallo Shutdown
===============

Stallo is getting old and will be shutdown this year.
Hardware failures cause more and more nodes to fail due to high age.
The system will stay in production and continue **service until
at least 1. Oct 2020**, the end of the current billing period (2020.1).

We will help you with finding alternatives to your computational and
storage needs and with moving your workflows and data to one of our
other machines like Betzy, Saga and Fram.

If you have questions, special needs or problems, please contact us at
