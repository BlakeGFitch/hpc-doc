Haskell Platform
=================

Haskell is an advanced purely-functional programming language. An open-source
product of more than twenty years of cutting-edge research, it allows rapid
development of robust, concise, correct software. With strong support for
integration with other languages, built-in concurrency and parallelism,
debuggers, profilers, rich libraries and an active community, Haskell makes it
easier to produce flexible, maintainable, high-quality software.

The advantages of using Haskell include: increased productivity, access to
higher level of abstraction for better code reuse, reliability, and high
performance on multicore processors. Haskell has been in development for over
20 years during which it matured into an industrial strength language.
Companies are using Haskell for everyday programming and for mission-critical
applications.
