CFOUR
======

CFOUR (Coupled-Cluster techniques for Computational
Chemistry) is a program package for performing high-level quantum mechanical
calculations on atoms and molecules. The major strength of the program suite
is its rather sophisticated arsenal of high-level ab initio methods for the
calculation of atomic and molecular properties. Virtually all approaches based
on Moller-Plesset (MP) perturbation theory and the coupled-cluster
approximation (CC) are available; most of these have complementary analytic
derivative approaches within the package as well.
