electronic structure calculations, where the emphasis is on highly accurate
computations, with extensive treatment of the electron correlation problem
through the multiconfiguration-reference CI, coupled cluster and associated
methods. Using recently developed integral-direct local electron correlation
methods, which significantly reduce the increase of the computational cost
with molecular size, accurate ab initio calculations can be performed for much
quitelarge molecules.
