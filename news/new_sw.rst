New software and module scheme
===============================

We have many new packages installed that are not visible by default, but all 
users have access to. These packages are installed in a new scheme and 
**all new software is and will be installed according to this scheme**. 
For several reasons we can not make these installations as the default setting for 
all users just yet, but we found it beneficial that you at least have access to them. 
Please note, that we might still do some changes without prior notice. In particular, 
the name of the packages and the behavior of lmod commands such as ``module load``, ``module 
avail``, ``module spider``, etc. is likely to change. If you have trouble finding something, 
or have some questions, please, check this manual and contact us.

Read more about this under the software section, :ref:`new_scheme`.
