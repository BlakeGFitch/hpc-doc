New software and module scheme
===============================

We have some new software packages installed. For several reasons these installations 
are still considered experimental an can change without prior notice. In particular, 
the name of the packages and the behavior of lmod commands such as `module load`, 
`module avail`, `module spider`, etc. is likely to change. 

Read more about this under the software section, :ref:`new_scheme`.
