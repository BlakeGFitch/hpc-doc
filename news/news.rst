News and notifications
======================


System status and activity
--------------------------

You can get a quick overview of the system load on Stallo
`here <http://www.notur.no/hardware/status/>`_. More information on the system load, queued jobs, and node states can be found `here <http://stallo-login1.uit.no/jobbrowser/>`_.  


Changes in system hardware, software or configuration
-----------------------------------------------------

Changes in system hardware, software or configuration will be published
on `UiT News <http://docs.notur.no/uit/uit-news>`_.
Headlines will also be displayed on the login screen of Stallo.


Planned/unplanned downtime
--------------------------

Planned/unplanned downtime will be announced on
`UiT News <http://docs.notur.no/uit/uit-news>`_.
In the case of a planned downtime, a reservation will be made in the queuing system, so new jobs, that would not finish until the downtime, won't start. If the system goes down, running jobs will be restarted, if possible. We apologize for any inconveniences this may cause.

.. Systems events log
.. ------------------

.. A `systems event log <http://stallo-adm.uit.no/wordpress/>`_ is available (unless Stallo is down), from which you can keep track of messages about such things as

.. * upcoming maintenance work
.. causes for unexpected down time
.. known problems
.. software upgrades
