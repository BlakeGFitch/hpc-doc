Status of migration to the SLURM resource manager
=================================================

Our plan is to replace the current resource management system by `SLURM
<http://slurm.schedmd.com/>`_ during this fall. This is the same system that is
currently used on `Abel
<http://www.uio.no/english/services/it/research/hpc/abel/>`_, the UiO
supercomputer.


Reason
------

One reason for the switch is that the resource management system we currently
use, the Torque-Maui scheduling system, is no longer actively maintained.  The
other reason is to make the user experience across Norwegian and Nordic HPC
systems more uniform and homogeneous.


Timeframe
---------

The migration process depends on the integration of the
accounting database with the new SLURM scheduling engine.
We currently aim for a transition on December 1st.


Migration process
-----------------

You will find here details of the migration process which we will
outline well in advance of the planned switch.
