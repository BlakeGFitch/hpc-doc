We have migrated to the SLURM resource manager
==============================================

We have replaced our past resource management system by `SLURM
<http://slurm.schedmd.com/>`_. This is the same system that is
currently used on
`Abel <http://www.uio.no/english/services/it/research/hpc/abel/>`_, the UiO
supercomputer.


Motivation
----------

One reason for the switch is that the Torque-Maui scheduling system that we
have used until now is no longer maintained.  The other reason is to make the
user experience across Norwegian and Nordic HPC systems more uniform and
homogeneous.
