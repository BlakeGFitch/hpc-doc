Status of migration to SLURM
============================

We plan to migrte til the `SLURM <http://slurm.schedmd.com/>`_ resource managment system (aka batch queueing system) during this fall. This is the same system that currently are being used on `Abel <http://www.uio.no/english/services/it/research/hpc/abel/>`_, the UiO supercomputer.

Reason:
--------

The resource managment system we currently use, the torque-maui scheduling systemty, is no longer maintained. This, therefore, represents a security liability. 

When we are forced to change, it is natural to choose a new system that is already used in NOTUR. Therefore SLURM.

Timeframe:
----------

The migration process is relaying heavily upon the process on integrating gold accounting database with the new slurm scheduling engine. We do not currently know when this will be fixed, so when the migration takes place is currently not clear.

Initially we aimed for November 1st, but in collaboration with the person taking care of the integration process this was moved. Currently, we aim for December 1st.

Migration process:
------------------

We have not deciced entirely, but we might try to do this without downtime. When we decide, you will be notified immediately.


We apologize for any inconveniences this may cause, but hope that you see the necessity and benefit of this process.
