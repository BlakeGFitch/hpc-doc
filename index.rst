.. attention::
   Stallo is getting old and will be shutdown this year.
   Hardware failures cause more and more nodes to fail due to high age.
   The **shutdown date has been postponed by one month** to help us prepare
   the infrastructure for the switch.
   The system will stay in production and continue **service until
   at least 1. November 2020**.

   We will help you with finding alternatives to your computational and
   storage needs and with moving your workflows and data to one of our
   other machines like Betzy, Saga and Fram.
   As we move closer to the shutdown, news, updated information and howtos
   will be published `on the official Sigma2 migration page
   <https://www.sigma2.no/migrating-stallo-and-vilje>`_
   and :ref:`here <stallo_shutdown>`.

   If you have questions, special needs or problems, please contact us at
   migration@metacenter.no
